"""Integration tests for UAT automation framework.

Integration tests validate Page Objects with real browser instances,
testing the actual integration between framework code and Selenium WebDriver.

These tests sit between unit tests (mocked) and E2E tests (full flows),
providing fast feedback on DOM interaction without running complete scenarios.
